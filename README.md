This is a tiny game idea using Unity that I just came up with. Stay tuned.

# Environment
## Apparatus

### React Machine
React Machine reacts to an input of an atomic trigger (e.g. a button, a switch, etc). 
There are two modes of input acceptance: With or without a specific value. For example: 
For a pressure button, a player standing on it will result in an "Enable" signal, and vice versa; 
However, for a switch, it just sends a trigger signal. The react machine will reverse its state 
when a signal is received.
